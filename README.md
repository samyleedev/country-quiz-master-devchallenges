## Overview

Here is my solution for the [Devchallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io/) country quiz challenge. Find out to which country this capital or this flag belongs. But be careful, you have no right to make a mistake !

### Functionalities

- I can see at least 2 types of questions: a city is the capital of.. or a flag belong to country..
- I can see select an answer
- I can see if my answer is correct or incorrect
- When I answer correctly, I can move on to the next question
- When I answer incorrectly, I can see my results and try again
- I can try again
